This repository maintains the documentation framework for AMRIT project. Built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the static pages are written as markdown files.

# Prerequisite 
### [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

This project uses Python. Please ensure that you have Python and pip installed. To install the Python packages listed in a `requirements.txt` file using pip, you can use the following command in your command prompt or terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, MkDocs can be installed with the following command:

```
pip install mkdocs
```
	  
Additionally swagger-ui-tag plug-in and material theme can be installed using the following commands:	

```
pip install mkdocs-swagger-ui-tag
pip install mkdocs-material
```
	  
MkDocs comes with a built-in development server that lets you preview your documentation as you work on it. Make sure you're in the same directory as the mkdocs.yml configuration file, and then start the server by running the mkdocs serve command.

```
mkdocs serve
```
  
Open up http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser, and you'll see the documentation home page being displayed.

# **Modify the documentation**
